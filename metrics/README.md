# GitHub Metrics

This directory contains self-hosted GitHub metrics SVG files generated by the `lowlighter/metrics` workflow.

## Files

The following SVG files are automatically generated and updated daily:

- `overview.svg` - General profile overview with achievements
- `github-stats.svg` - Repository and follow-up statistics  
- `top-languages.svg` - Most used programming languages
- `contributions.svg` - Contribution calendar and coding habits

## How It Works

1. The `.github/workflows/metrics.yml` workflow runs daily (and on push to main)
2. It uses [lowlighter/metrics](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics) to generate SVG panels
3. Generated files are committed directly to this directory
4. The README.md references these local files instead of external APIs

## Note

If SVG files are missing, trigger the workflow manually:

1. Go to Actions → Metrics → Run workflow
2. Wait for completion
3. Pull the latest changes

The SVG files will be generated and committed automatically.
