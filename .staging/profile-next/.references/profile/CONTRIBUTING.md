## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- Poetry (for Python dependency management)
- npm (for Node.js dependencies)
- (Optional) [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) for local GitHub Actions testing

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/szmyty/profile.git
   cd profile
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
   
   **Note:** GitHub Actions workflows automatically create and use a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) to ensure isolation and PEP 668 compliance. This virtual environment is already in `.gitignore`.

3. **Install Node.js dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd dashboard-app && npm install
   ```

4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

5. **Build the dashboard:**
   ```bash
   cd dashboard-app
   npm run build
   ```

### Testing Workflows Locally with act

You can test GitHub Actions workflows locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

1. **Install act:**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install act
   
   # Linux
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```

2. **Create a `.secrets` file** (copy from `.secrets.example`):
   ```bash
   cp .secrets.example .secrets
   # Edit .secrets and add your tokens
   ```

3. **Run a workflow:**
   ```bash
   # Test individual action
   act --job test-action --input action=fetch-location --secret-file .secrets
   
   # Test the act demo workflow
   act -W .github/workflows/act-demo.yml
   ```

**Note:** The setup actions now use Python virtual environments, which prevents PEP 668 errors when running with act on Python 3.12+.
